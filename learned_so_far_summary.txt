My Personal Learned So Far Notes 

1. got a glipmse of basic concept/goal of .net core as a whole. 
-  Microsoft open its door to cross platform in mind that its the future of software development. Product owners dont usually 
use a specific environment for their solutions. Developing on every single OS enviromnent is costy for a business that want 
to target all audience. As relevancy of other OS environment increases, the need of cross platform tool became relevant as well. 

2. Learned REST.
- while GET and POST is relevat to me as my previous enviromnent "PHP" as I exploring on Web API Development, 
REST was been introduced to me. In my understanding its concept is like CRUD of traditional database but its more on user request and wait
for expected response to the API Service Server.

3. Learned some useful feature on ASP.net core for Web API development.  
- Learned that it has automatic dependency injection feature which can make intances of interface managable. Its a very cool. 

4. My understanding of Designing Web APIs so far. 
Roadmap:
 1. create a request model. 
 2. create a context for the model 
 3. create a in-memory database for the requests. 
 4. create a controller for the business logic. 
 5. by taking advantage of in-memory database, the API might able to serve under heavy request traffic(assuming its controlled in some way) due to its fast data retrieval.
 6. if somehow need to save a log, data will be saved in a traditional database storage disk.
